ETHpillan - a new tablet to increase the hashrate on video cards from AMD and NVIDIA. The project was developed for more than six months and showed the best results during testing. 
Features and hashrate you can see below.
The goal of the project is to test your skills in programming, studying the filling in video cards.
It is also an opportunity to present the project to the general public for free mining and feedback, for further improvement

How it works:
1) launch the desired miner
2) after a few minutes, launch the tablet
On average, the hashrate will increase for an hour until it reaches its peak value

Features
1) Support AMD/Nvidia cards
2) Support all miners 
3) Support all projects on Ethash/KawPow/ProgPow algo
4) Stable operation on the Windows, from Win7 to Win10 with the latest updates
5) The increase in hashrate in miners using our tablet is at least 15%

The project is not commercial, dev fee is not used.
